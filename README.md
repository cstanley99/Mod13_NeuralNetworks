The model uses data from a venture capital fund to try and predict whether or not entities seeking funding will be successful.  The data is provided by the venture company and the code uses neural networks (with tensorflow and keras optimization) to make predictions.  After several diffent optimizations, the output data suggests this is a difficult task for a machine learning model.
